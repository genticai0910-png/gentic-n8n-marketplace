## Key Learnings & Best Practices

### What Works

1. **Outcome-focused naming**: "Voice Agent Qualifier" beats "n8n Phone Automation Template"
2. **Tiered pricing with feature gaps**: Basic gets you started, Pro adds scripts, VIP adds playbook + community
3. **Social proof in listings**: "47 signups, $3,200 MRR" converts better than feature lists
4. **Clear file trees**: Buyers want to see exactly what they're getting
5. **Generous refund policies**: 60-day guarantees increase trust, reduce actual refunds

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Generic "templates"**: Too broad. "SaaS Founder" beats "Business Owner"
2. **Listing without FAQs**: Answer objections before they email you
3. **No clear setup time**: "30 minutes to deploy" beats vague "easy setup"
4. **Missing test payloads**: Buyers want to validate before integrating
5. **Overpromising results**: "Go viral instantly" kills trust. "60 days to see growth" is honest.
