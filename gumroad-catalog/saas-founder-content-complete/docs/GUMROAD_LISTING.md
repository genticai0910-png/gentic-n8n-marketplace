## Description

### The Problem With SaaS Content Marketing

You know you need to post content. But between building features, talking to customers, and keeping the lights on... content falls to the bottom.

When you do post, it's crickets. Your insights get 40 views. Your product demos get 3 likes.

**Meanwhile, less technical founders are going viral daily.**

### What's Actually Working in 2025

SaaS founders crushing it on TikTok/IG aren't posting about features. They're posting:
- Behind-the-scenes build logs (gets 10x more engagement than product demos)
- "Here's the mistake that cost us $40K" stories (instant saves)
- Tactical tutorials that lead back to your tool (warm traffic that converts at 12%+)

This pack gives you the exact framework.

### What You Get — Complete VIP Pack

**50 Viral Hooks for SaaS Founders**
- "I spent $80K on ads before learning this..."
- "Building in public day 47: we just hit $10K MRR and I'm terrified"
- "If your SaaS churn is above 5%, you're ignoring this metric"
- + 47 more proven formulas with virality ratings

**50 Content Ideas (With Viral Potential Scores)**
- Launch announcements that don't flop (3 frameworks)
- Customer win stories that drive signups (5 templates)
- Technical tutorials positioned as lead magnets (12 topics)
- "Building in public" updates that build audience trust
- Pricing/positioning content that pre-qualifies buyers

**30 Done-For-You Avatar Scripts (45-60 sec each)**
Complete scripts with:
- Hook (0-3 sec): Scroll-stopping opener
- Body (3-40 sec): Value delivery
- CTA (40-45 sec): Signup/follow call-to-action
- Platform notes: Where it performs best (TikTok/IG/YouTube)

**Platform-Specific Hashtag Sets**
- TikTok: 10 high-volume sets (#buildinpublic, #saas, #indiehacker)
- Instagram: 15 high-volume + 10 niche sets
- YouTube: SEO-optimized tags for shorts
- LinkedIn: Industry-specific tags that get executive eyeballs

**30-Day Content Calendar**
Daily posting plan with:
- Which script to use
- Which platform to post on
- Optimal posting time (based on SaaS audience behavior)
- Content pillar rotation (education/entertainment/promotion balance)

**Caption Templates (50+ variants)**
- Product launch captions that convert
- Tutorial-style captions with CTAs
- Story-based captions that build connection
- Engagement-bait captions (use sparingly, but they work)

**2,500-Word SaaS Content Playbook**
The strategy behind everything:
- Why most SaaS founders fail at content (and how to avoid it)
- Platform prioritization: Start TikTok or LinkedIn? (Depends on your ICP)
- Content creation workflow: 2 hours/week → 7 days of content
- Analytics: What metrics actually matter (hint: not followers)
- Paid amplification: When and how to boost for signups

### Who This Is For

**Perfect fit:**
- SaaS founders doing $0-$50K MRR looking to drive organic signups
- Technical founders who hate "creating content"
- Post-PMF products that need awareness, not more features
- Teams with <$5K/mo ad budget (content is your distribution lever)

**Not for you if:**
- You're pre-product (build first, market second)
- You have a $50K+/mo content budget (hire an agency)
- Your ICP is 60+ year olds (they're not on TikTok)

### Why This Works (Real Numbers)

"Used 8 of the hooks in month 1. Went from 400 followers to 12K in 6 weeks. More importantly: 47 signups directly from bio link, $3,200 MRR from content alone."
— Maya S., Project Management SaaS

"The 30-day calendar is stupid simple. I film 3 videos on Sunday, post throughout the week. Spend maybe 3 hours total. Getting 50-200K views per video now."
— David L., Developer Tools

## FAQs

**Q: I'm not comfortable on camera. Will this work?**
A: Yes, but you'll get 50% of the results. Text-over-footage and voiceover content can still work, but face-to-camera builds more trust. Start with voiceover and transition over time.

**Q: Do I need to post on all platforms?**
A: No. The playbook tells you which platform to prioritize based on your ICP (PLG SaaS → TikTok/IG, Enterprise → LinkedIn).

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: Expect 30 days to find your rhythm, 60 days to see real follower growth, 90 days to see consistent signups from content. This is not a "post once and go viral" system.

**Q: Can I use this for my agency/service business?**
A: The hooks/scripts are written for SaaS founders, but 80% translate to B2B services. You'll need to adapt language.

**Q: What if I run out of content after 30 days?**
A: The 50 content ideas are reusable. Reframe #8 for your new feature. Remix #14 with updated numbers. Content is iterative, not one-and-done.
