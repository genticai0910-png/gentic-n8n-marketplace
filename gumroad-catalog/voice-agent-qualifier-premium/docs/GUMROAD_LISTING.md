Voice AI Lead Qualifier — Turn Cold Calls Into Qualified Appointments in 90 Seconds

## Price
$37

## Tagline
Done-for-you n8n workflow that deploys voice AI agents to qualify leads, book appointments, and integrate with your CRM — no coding required.

## Description

### Stop Wasting Time on Unqualified Leads

Every cold call costs you time, energy, and money. What if your AI could handle the first conversation, qualify the lead, and only send you people ready to buy?

**This n8n workflow does exactly that.**

### What You Get

**Plug-and-play voice agent system:**
- Pre-built qualification script (real estate, solar, insurance, or B2B)
- Retell/VAPI/Bland integration with fallback routing
- Live CRM sync (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, or webhook)
- SMS/email follow-up sequences based on qualification score
- Appointment booking with calendar integration

**Complete setup in under 30 minutes:**
1. Import workflow.json into n8n
2. Configure your voice platform credentials
3. Customize qualification questions in CONFIG.json
4. Deploy and start routing calls

### Why This Works

**Traditional approach:**
- Sales reps spend 4+ hours/day on unqualified calls
- 70% of leads never answer follow-up calls
- Manual CRM entry = data inconsistency

**With Voice AI Qualifier:**
- AI handles 100% of initial qualification
- Instant lead scoring (0-100) based on budget, timeline, authority
- Auto-routes hot leads to your calendar, nurtures cold leads
- Zero manual data entry
